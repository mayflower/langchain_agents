    "## Erster Test\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI-Modelle\n",
    "ChatGPT oder auch jedes andere LLM benutzen ist relativ einfach mit Langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "In diesen Test nutzen wir das neueste \"gpt-4-turbo\" Model - mögliche Large Language Modelle von OpenAI sind:\n",
    "- `gpt-35-turbo`  Das günstigste und am weitesten verbreitete Modell\n",
    "- `gpt-4`  Das neue und bessere GPT Modell\n",
    "- `gpt-4-turbo`  Turbo-variante von gpt-4 (günstiger, schneller, kleinere maximale Länge des Text-Outputs)\n",
    "- `gpt-4-vision`  Ein \"multimodales\" Modell, welches auch auf Bilder trainiert wurde.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI trainiert diese Versionen laufend neu, was dazu führen kann, das Anfragen an das LLM plötzlich andere Antworten geben.\n",
    "Möchte man dies verhindern, kann man seine Applikation auf einen Snapshot (z.b. gpt-4-0613) festsetzen.\n",
    "Dies ist insbesondere wichtig, wenn die Applikation vom Output des LLM bestimmte Strukturen erwartet, beispielsweise eine bestimmte XML-Syntax o.Ä.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI-Modelle werden nicht nur von OpenAI selbst gehostet, sondern auch von Azure.\n",
    "Diese muss man auf dem Azure Portal selbst als Endpunkte konfigurieren, in der Regel leiden die OpenAI Azure Deployments weniger unter hoher Auslastung\n",
    "\n",
    "### Andere Modelle\n",
    "Auch wenn wir nicht damit arbeiten werden, ist es vielleicht ganz gut, die Namen der \"großen\" Konkurrenz-Modelle einmal gehört zu haben:\n",
    "- `Gemini` Das neueste Google-Modell. Es hat den Fokus insbesondere auf multimodalem Input.\n",
    "- `Claude` Claude ist die LLM-Reihe von Anthropic. Sehr viel Instruction-Tuning.\n",
    "- `Mixtral` Das aktuell beste Open-Source Modell. Entwickelt von Mistral AI. Ein guter Kandidat für ein selbst gehostetes LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperatur\n",
    "Alle LLMs sind nicht deterministisch. Aber die Temperatur ist ein Parameter, mit der man die Variabilität von Antworten hoch und runter schrauben kann.\n",
    "Wie bei normalen Atomen ist die Bewegung niedrig, wenn die Temperatur niedrig ist. Wenn man die Temperatur hochschraubt, wird viel gewackelt.\n",
    "Der Temperatur-Parameter ist üblicherweise ein Fließkommawert zwischen 0 und 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming\n",
    "Nicht alle LLMs bieten die Möglichkeit, Token für Token live zu streamen. OpenAI-Modelle können es, man kann dies mit dem Streaming-Parameter einstellen.\n",
    "\n",

Diese kann Rahmenanweisungen enthalten, an die sich das LLM halten soll. Dem Nutzer wird es schwer fallen, das LLM dazu zu bewegen, sich über eine Anweisung in der System-Message hinweg zu setzen.

    "## Embeddings (Textembeddings, Vektoren)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beim Embedden wird ein Textstück genommen und in einen hochdimensionalen Vektor umgewandelt. Es gibt unterschiedliche Methoden, wie dieser Vektor erstellt wird und die genaue Art und Weise, wie der Embeddingprozess vonstatten geht, ist eine kleine Wissenschaft für sich.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Allerdings haben alle Embeddings folgende Eigenschaft: Wenn zwei Textstücke ähnlichen Inhalt haben, liegen die resultierenden Vektoren im Raum nahe beieinander.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Man erhält durch den Embeddingprozess also eine Möglichkeit, sehr viel (!) Text, zusammen mit der Information, wie ähnlich diese Sätze inhaltlich sind, abzuspeichern!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vektoren können vom Computer sehr schnell verarbeitet werden. Man kann damit dann so schöne Dinge tun wie:\n",
    "- Suche (wobei die Ergebnisse nach semantischer Relevanz geordnet werden)\n",
    "- Clustering (wobei Textzeichenfolgen nach Ähnlichkeit gruppiert werden)\n",
    "- Empfehlungen (wobei Elemente mit zugehörigen Textzeichenfolgen empfohlen werden)\n",
    "- Anomalieerkennung (wobei Ausreißer mit geringem Zusammenhang identifiziert werden)\n",
    "- Klassifizierung (wobei Textzeichenfolgen nach ihrer ähnlichsten Bezeichnung klassifiziert werden)\n",
    "\n",
    "Die Standard Anwendung ist wie folgt:\n",
    "- Alle Dokumente, die die Wissensdatenbank bilden (z.B. Betriebsanleitungen eines Maschinenherstellers) werden vektorisiert.\n",
    "- Dann stellt ein Nutzer eine Anfrage an die KI (bezüglich einer Maschine).\n",
    "- Diese Frage wird ebenfalls vektorisiert (das geht sehr schnell).\n",
    "- Dann wird in den Vektoren der Betriebsanleitungen nach ähnlichen Vektoren gesucht (geht auch sehr schnell).\n",
    "- Die ähnlichsten Vektoren werden rückaufgelöst (d.h. man sieht nach, welche ursprünglichen Dokumente hinter den Vektoren stehen).\n",
    "- Diese Dokumente werden dann der AI als Kontext zum Beantworten der Frage mitzugeben.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings machen dies möglich, weil sie nicht auf der Grundlage von Zeichenfolgen arbeiten sondern wirklich eine semantische Nähe zueinander finden. Die Wörter \"König\" und \"Prinz\" sind sich im Vektorraum sehr ähnlich, obwohl die Wörter sich stark unterscheiden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Es gibt sehr viele Embedding-Modelle, die für alle möglichen Fälle optimiert sind.\n",
    "Modelle können einpsrachig oder mehrsprachig sein, wobei man für die mehrsprachigkeit einen Qualitätsverlust in Kauf nehmen muss!\n",
    "Es gibt multimodale Embeddings die z.B. für das Wort Schraube und das Bild einer Schraube sehr ähnliche Vektoren herausgeben.\n",
